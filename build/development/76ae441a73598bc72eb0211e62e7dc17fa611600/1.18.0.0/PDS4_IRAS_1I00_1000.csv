It is distinct from OBSERVATION_TIME, which is the midpoint of the observation period, in that it is calculated by taking the arithmetic average of all event times associated with the single observation. For IRAS Additional Observation (AO) images, this is the observing time spent on the target. The rest of the time was used to make fine attitude updates on reference stars at the beginning and at the end of an AO.
